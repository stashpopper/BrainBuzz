# Room Cleanup Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented automatic cleanup of empty public quiz rooms to prevent database bloat and improve system efficiency.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (`backend/server.js`)

#### New Functions Added:

1. **`cleanupEmptyPublicRooms(roomCode)`**
   - Checks if a room is public and has no participants
   - Deletes the room from database if conditions are met
   - Emits `roomDeleted` event to all clients
   - Only affects public rooms (isPrivate = false)

2. **`removeParticipantFromRoom(roomCode, userId)`**
   - Removes a specific participant from a room
   - Updates participant count in real-time
   - Emits `participantLeft` event to remaining participants
   - Triggers cleanup check after participant removal

#### Socket Event Updates:

1. **`joinRoom` Event**
   - Now stores `userId` and `currentRoom` in socket object
   - Enables tracking for cleanup on disconnect

2. **`leaveRoom` Event**
   - Updated to accept `{ roomCode, userId }` object
   - Calls `removeParticipantFromRoom` for proper cleanup

3. **`disconnect` Event**
   - Now automatically removes disconnected users from their current room
   - Triggers cleanup if room becomes empty

### Frontend Changes

#### Socket Service (`frontend/src/services/socketService.js`)
- **`leaveRoom` method**: Updated to send both roomCode and userId

#### Quiz Room Component (`frontend/src/pages/QuizRoom.jsx`)
- **Room cleanup**: Updated `leaveRoom` call to include user ID
- **New event listener**: Added `roomDeleted` event handler
- **User notification**: Shows alert when room is automatically deleted
- **Navigation**: Automatically redirects to room list when room is deleted
- **Participant updates**: Added `participantLeft` event listener for real-time updates

## Feature Specifications

### Automatic Deletion Triggers:
1. **Manual Leave**: When a user manually leaves a room
2. **Browser Close**: When a user closes their browser/tab
3. **Connection Loss**: When a user loses internet connection
4. **Socket Disconnect**: Any socket disconnection event

### Protection Rules:
- ✅ **Public rooms**: Automatically deleted when empty
- ❌ **Private rooms**: Preserved when empty (not deleted)
- ✅ **Real-time updates**: All participants see live participant count changes
- ✅ **User notification**: Users are alerted when rooms are deleted

### Technical Flow:
1. User leaves room (any method)
2. Backend removes user from participants array
3. Backend checks if room is public and empty
4. If conditions met, room is deleted from database
5. `roomDeleted` event is emitted to all clients
6. Frontend receives event and redirects affected users

## Database Impact
- **Prevents accumulation** of abandoned public rooms
- **Maintains data integrity** by preserving private rooms
- **Reduces storage overhead** for temporary quiz sessions
- **Improves query performance** by reducing room collection size

## User Experience Improvements
- **Real-time participant tracking**: Users see live updates when others join/leave
- **Automatic cleanup notification**: Clear messaging when rooms are removed
- **Seamless navigation**: Automatic redirect prevents broken room states
- **No manual intervention required**: System self-maintains room lifecycle

## Testing Coverage
- ✅ Single user leave/disconnect scenarios
- ✅ Multiple user leave scenarios  
- ✅ Private room protection verification
- ✅ Active quiz state handling
- ✅ Socket disconnect edge cases
- ✅ Real-time UI updates
- ✅ Database consistency checks

## Error Handling
- **Try-catch blocks** around all async operations
- **Graceful degradation** if cleanup fails
- **Console logging** for debugging and monitoring
- **Client-side error boundaries** for socket events
